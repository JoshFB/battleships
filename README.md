# Battleships

Test your nerve with this classic war simulation! Built primarily in Ruby, this is a take on the original two-player game.

The brief:

> _Battleships is a game where each player places a number of ships on a board. The board is a 10x10 two dimensional grid._
> _After the ships have been placed on a players board each player takes turns to shoot on the opponents board. In each round, each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. The opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship, and if it is a hit they mark this on their own primary grid. The attacking player notes the hit or miss on their own tracking grid, in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet._

> _When all the opponents ships have been hit by the game finishes._
